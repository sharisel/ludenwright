        What Makes Us Unique
        </div>
    </header>
       <div class = "text">
        Weâ€™re building the activities we organize at Ludenwright around Self-Determination Theory (SDT), which highlights the importance of:
        <br>
        <div class = "itemlist">
        <br><b>Autonomy:</b> Your ability to shape your own path and make meaningful choices.
        <br><b>Competence:</b> Gaining mastery through growth and learning.
        <br><b>Relatedness:</b> Connecting with others and building relationships that matter.
        <br>
        </div>
        <br>We integrate these principles to cultivate a community where everyone can thrive and create freely. With features like automated guidance systems, mentorship opportunities, and a commitment to openness, Ludenwright stands apart as a hub for game creators to gather, network, and succeed. Additionally, weâ€™re committed to the following guidelines:
        <br>
        <div class = "itemlist">
        <br><b>Transparency and Ethical Responsibility:</b> Every decision we make aligns with our community's needs and feedback.
        <br><b>Tools to Amplify Creativity:</b> From feedback frameworks to gamified skill-building, we ensure you're equipped to succeed.
        <br><b>Servant Leadership:</b>Our leadership exists to elevate your potential and ensure shared success.
        <br><b>No Claim to Your IP:</b> Pretty straightforward; you own what you make, and we want to help you sell what you own. Our showcase gallery gives you a public space to show off what you own under a licensing agreement of your choosing, and all code and assets will be managed by you and your team under a mutually agreed upon license.
        Donâ€™t worry, weâ€™ll help you sort it ðŸ˜€

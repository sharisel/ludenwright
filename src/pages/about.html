    <div class = "text">
        The word "Ludenwright" derives from the latin word <i>Luden</i>, meaning "play", and the Olde English 
        word <i>Wright</i>, meaning "maker" or "builder". Coming together, this word informs our philosophy of 
        "play makers" and creators who build experiences that inspire, challenge, and immerse. 
        
    <br><br> At Ludenwright, we believe in the power of play. As such, we strive to create a community that fosters 
    creativity and empowers indie game developers' commitment to crafting interactive worlds.
